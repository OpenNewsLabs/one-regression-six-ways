# one-regression-six-ways

Code and data for my blog post, [**6 ways to run a "simple" regression**](http://underthecurve.github.io/jekyll/update/2016/07/01/one-regression-six-ways.html), in which I ran a regression of health vs. income using the following 6 tools:

* Excel
* R
* Stata
* SAS
* PSPP
* Python (statsmodels)

In each of these tools, I ran the regression, drew diagnostic plots to assess the model fit, tried to identify outliers, and created a dataset with the fitted values and residuals.

I hope this will showcase the different approaches of each tool take toward running a simple linear regression.
